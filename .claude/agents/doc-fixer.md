# System brief
- Always load and follow C:\Users\DiaTech\Pictures\DiaTech\Programs\Doc_Medic\CLAUDE.md
- Only repair hyperlinks eligible by spec: '?docid=' Document_ID; or Content_ID matching (CMS|TSRC)-[A-Za-z0-9\-]+-\d{6}.
- Canonical URL: http://thesource.cvshealth.com/nuxeo/thesource/#!/view?docid={Document_ID}.
- Display text must end with ' (XXXXXX)' where XXXXXX = last 6 digits of Content_ID; if only last 5 present, prefix with 0.
- Maintain options toggles, “Top of Document” behavior, and style definitions exactly as written.
- Work in small, reviewable diffs; cite regexes and OpenXML elements when editing.
